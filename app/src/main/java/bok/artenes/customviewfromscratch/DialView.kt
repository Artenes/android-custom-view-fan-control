         *
         * The problem:
         *
         * We have a circle.
         * We want to put a view inside/outside it based on its center.
         * Like if this view is attached to the center of the circle and
         * we can change its position by changing the angle it is in relation
         * to the center of the circle.
         *
         * The solution:
         *
         * Parametric Equation of a Circle (https://www.mathopenref.com/coordparamcircle.html)
         * In the link above there is a more clear explanation on how this works, but basically
         * we use pythagoras theorem for right triangles and the trigonometry functions sin and cos.
         *
         * The idea is that the radius is the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Its base
         * (which is the x coordinate) can be calculated using the cos function and its height
         * (which is the y coordinate) is calculated using the sin function.
         *
         * But the sin and cos functions only give us the ration of the size between the side of the
         * triangle and the hypotenuse. To actually get the size, we have to multiple the value
         * by the radius of the circle (that is the hypotenuse). So we end up with this formula:
         *
         * x = radius * cos(angle)
         * y = radius * sin(angle)
         *
         * BUT, this only works if the center of the circle is in the position 0,0. Since Android
         * points its 0,0 position at the top left corner of the screen, we have to adjust the formula
         * to compensate for this.
         *
         * x = radius * cos(angle) + (width / 2)
         * y = radius * sin(angle) + (height / 2)
         *
         * Where the width/2 and height/2 are the x and y centers of our circle in the Android coordinates system.
         */

        /**
         * We want to calculate a position in a circle in relation with its center.
         * For that we use angles (in radians).
         * In radians we use PI as the base for defining the angle.
         * Like in this image (http://cameronmitchellportfolio.weebly.com/uploads/1/8/3/4/18347141/3587536_orig.png)
         * we have to multiply PI by a fraction to actually move it around the 360 degrees of a circle.
         * In this case this fraction served well to put the view in the initial angle that we wanted.
         * This fraction can be any value that you want that puts the view where you need.
         * One of the numbers must have a fraction (.0) for the division not be considered an integer division
         * which would yield a wrong result. Int division = 1, float/double division = 1.125
